# Robot model

This project is for designing the control of a differential drive robot.

### Update strategies

The kinematic model alternates between updating the orientation and the position. The velocity drive model uses the halfway orientation for updating the position.

Comparison of different update strategies while having a `0.1 sec` update cycle with `1 rad/sec` difference between the left angular velocity and the right angular velocity and `6.5 rad/sec` angular velocity of the right wheel:

Results: new theta

The error still accumulates over time only at a slower pace. See `VelocityControlledDifferentialDrive` tests for details.
